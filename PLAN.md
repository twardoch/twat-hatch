# Plan for Streamlining `twat-hatch` Codebase (MVP v1.0)

This document outlines the detailed step-by-step plan to streamline the `twat-hatch` codebase, focusing on creating a performant, focused v1.0 (MVP).

## Overall Goal
Identify and address redundant or obsolete code, consolidate duplicate portions, and remove inefficient fluff (like overly verbose comments or inefficient structures) while retaining all core functionality for an MVP.

## Detailed Steps:

1.  **Analyze `cleanup.py` and `repomix` usage:**
    *   **Task**: Compare the functionality of `cleanup.py repomix` (generating `REPO_CONTENT.txt`) and the external `npx repomix` (generating `llms.txt` for AI analysis). Determine if `REPO_CONTENT.txt` is redundant for the project's core goals or if it serves a distinct, valuable purpose within `cleanup.py`.
    *   **Assessment**:
        *   `llms.txt` is specified for AI interaction for the current streamlining task.
        *   `REPO_CONTENT.txt` is generated by `cleanup.py` as part of its standard operation, using different ignore patterns and outputting to a different file. It appears to be part of `cleanup.py`'s logging/status reporting mechanism.
    *   **Decision**: No code changes. `REPO_CONTENT.txt` generation will be retained within `cleanup.py` as it's part of that utility's intended functionality and output. `llms.txt` serves the separate purpose of AI-driven analysis for this specific refactoring task. The two can coexist.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

2.  **Review `PyVer` in `src/twat_hatch/utils.py`:**
    *   **Task**: Examine the parsing logic in `PyVer.parse` and `PyVer.from_cli_input`. Identify if all supported input formats are truly necessary for an MVP and simplify if possible, prioritizing clarity and robustness for core formats.
    *   **Assessment**:
        *   `PyVer.parse()` supports several string formats (e.g., "3.10", "3.10.0", "3.10 Final", "py310", "3").
        *   `PyVer.from_cli_input()` is more specific (e.g., (3,10), "3,10").
        *   The logic to handle "3.10 Final" (by splitting on space) and redundant internal validation for minor version numbers in `parse()` were identified as areas for simplification.
    *   **Decision & Implementation**:
        *   Modified `PyVer.parse()` in `src/twat_hatch/utils.py`:
            *   Removed the line `version_str = version_str.split()[0]` to stop parsing space-separated suffixes like "Final". Versions like "3.10" or "3.10.0" are now required.
            *   Removed redundant `if minor < 0 or minor > 99:` checks, relying on the `__post_init__` method for this validation.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

3.  **Examine `PackageConfig.from_toml` in `src/twat_hatch/hatch.py`:**
    *   **Task**: Assess if the manual extraction of TOML sections in `PackageConfig.from_toml` can be significantly simplified using Pydantic's capabilities for loading nested models, without overly complex refactoring or altering the user-facing config structure detrimentally.
    *   **Assessment**:
        *   The current method manually maps TOML sections to a flat `PackageConfig` model.
        *   Simplifying this to a direct Pydantic `model_validate` call would require `PackageConfig` to become a nested model structure, which would then impact how configuration is accessed throughout the application (especially in Jinja2 template contexts).
    *   **Decision**: No code changes. The current implementation, while manual, is clear and directly serves its purpose. A major simplification would involve a larger refactoring of `PackageConfig` and its usage, which is beyond conservative MVP streamlining.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

4.  **Simplify `.gitignore`:**
    *   **Task**: Review the extensive `.gitignore` file and remove patterns not relevant to a Python project, retaining essential Python-related, OS-specific, IDE-specific, and project-specific ignores.
    *   **Assessment**: The existing `.gitignore` was very comprehensive, including patterns for many languages and IDEs not relevant to this Python project.
    *   **Decision & Implementation**:
        *   Replaced the content of `.gitignore` with a more focused set of rules tailored for Python projects.
        *   Ensured common Python artifacts (`__pycache__`, virtual environments, build outputs), OS-generated files, common IDE directories, and project-specific generated files (`__version__.py`, `llms.txt`, `REPO_CONTENT.txt`, `CLEANUP.txt`) are ignored.
        *   Kept the `!dist/.gitkeep` rule.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

5.  **Review CLI arguments in `src/twat_hatch/__main__.py`:**
    *   **Task**: Specifically look at the `init` function's arguments. Assess if any arguments are redundant or could be grouped for better clarity without sacrificing essential MVP functionality.
    *   **Assessment**:
        *   The `init` function has 13 arguments, which is high but common for `fire`-based CLIs that aim to provide comprehensive non-interactive options.
        *   It has a good mechanism for switching to interactive mode if key arguments are not provided.
        *   All arguments map directly to configuration options.
    *   **Decision**: No code changes. The current argument structure is functional and provides necessary control for both interactive and non-interactive use. Removing arguments would reduce functionality. Grouping them would complicate the `fire` CLI.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

6.  **Review comments in `pyproject.toml.j2` templates:**
    *   **Task**: Identify and remove comments in `src/twat_hatch/themes/default/pyproject.toml.j2` that are overly verbose, state the obvious, or are not essential for an MVP. Retain comments that clarify non-obvious choices or configurations.
    *   **Assessment**: The template had many comments, some of which were prescriptive about dependency updates or very detailed for common tools.
    *   **Decision & Implementation**:
        *   Simplified comments for project dependencies, optional dependencies (dev/test), and build system requirements by removing prescriptive advice on versioning and focusing on the purpose of the dependency.
        *   Fixed a minor typo in a comment related to Hatch environments.
        *   Added/clarified brief functional descriptions for some less obvious settings in pytest, coverage, and Hatch environment configurations to maintain clarity.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

7.  **Create `PLAN.md`:**
    *   **Task**: Document the detailed step-by-step plan (this file).
    *   **Status**: This step. (In Progress)

8.  **Create `TODO.md`:**
    *   **Task**: Create a simplified checklist version of this `PLAN.md`.
    *   **Status**: Pending.

9.  **Implement Changes and Update Documentation (Ongoing with each step):**
    *   **Task**: For each change implemented:
        *   Update `CHANGELOG.md` to record the modification.
        *   Update this `PLAN.md` to mark the step as in progress/complete and add details of the implementation.
        *   Update `TODO.md` to check off the completed task.
    *   Run `cleanup.py update` (or equivalent if `cleanup.py` is modified) periodically.
    *   **Status**: Ongoing.

10. **Final Review and Submission:**
    *   **Task**: Run all checks (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`) to ensure the codebase is clean and tests pass. Submit the changes with a comprehensive commit message.
    *   **Status**: Pending.
